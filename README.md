# visualizers

Each folder contains code for a shiny app to visualize something. 

A shiny app has two key files:
* `server.R` 
* `ui.R`

The code in the `/demo/` folder can be found in [this tutorial](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/shinyapps.html?_ga=2.17148665.170292161.1644119934-1478339637.1644119934).
